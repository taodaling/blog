# Overview

Redis is an open source, advanced key-value store and an apt solution for building high-performance, scalable web applications.

Redis has three main peculiarities that sets it apart.

- redis holds its database entirely in the memory, using the disk only for persistence.
- redis has a relatively rich set of data types when compared to many key-value data stores.
- redis can replicate data to any number of slaves.
