# Concepts

## Docker

Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, deploy, and run applications with containers.

## Images and containers

A container is launched by running an image. An image is an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application - the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables and configuration files.

A container is a runtime instance of an image.

## Containers and virtual machines

A container runs natively on Linux and shares the kernel of the host machine with other containers. It runs a discrete process, taking no more memory than any other executable, making it lightweight.

By constrast, a virtual machine runs a full-blown guest operating system with virtual access to host resources through a hypervisor. In general, VMs provide an environment with more resources than most application need.

## Docker layers

1. **Stack** : defining the interactions of all the services
2. **Services** : defining how containers behave in production.
3. **Container** : the bottom of the hierarchy of such an app.

# Command

## ls

```
docker image ls
```

List all image

```sh
docker container ls [--all]
```

List all container running, if --all is given, dead one will be shown.

## build

```sh
docker build [-t name] dir
```

build image by dir/Dockerfile with name

## run

```sh
docker run [-d] [-p localport:virtualport] <imagename>
```

start image

- **-p** : mapping virtualport into localport
- **-d** : run in detach mode

## stop

```sh
docker container stop <containerid>
```

Stop container by id.

# Dockerfile

These portable images are defined by something called a `Dockerfile`.

Dockerfile defines what goes on in the environment inside your container. Access to resources like networking interfaces and disk drives is virtualized inside this environment, which is isolated from the rest of your system, so you need to map ports to the outside world, and the specified about what files you want to copy in to that environment. 

However, after doing that, you can expect that the build of your app defined in this dockerfile behaves exactly the same wherever it runs.

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:2.7-slim

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```
